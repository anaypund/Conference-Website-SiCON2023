SiCON 2023 (International COnference on IoT, Big Data and Machine Learning)

An website which manages all the tasks for an reviewer to check and evaluate the papers and journals.	
The logic is developed in such a way that everything can be done just on a click.

Automatic ID generation, file handling, trash database, payment recipt check, automatic emails, paper evaluation admin panel (add /admin in front of the link) and many more.

If you want to use the code without any errors:			
	1. Add your emails in src/main.js file (I've leaved the emails field blank for you and added a comment "//add some field")
	2. Connect to one of your database first to make the site useful and running.
	3. add a .env file and insert the MONGO_URI to successfully connect the database.
	4. That's It!
